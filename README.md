-About this Portfolio
Design creation is skipped. We created a copy of the Prototype in Figma based on the sample image and proceeded with coding.
The theme of the coding was to get used to HTML and to understand how it works, so  did not code screen transitions, but rather faithfully followed the design.

*If you like it, please send me a work order.
