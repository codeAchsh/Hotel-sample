In order to deepen my understanding of the parts I did not understand, I skipped the design process and used Figma to create a copy of the Prototype based on the sample images and proceeded with the coding.
I chose the simplest design possible. I decided not to code the screen transitions this time, but to follow the design closely in order to understand how HTML works.

Design creation is skipped. We created a copy of the Prototype in Figma based on the sample image and proceeded with coding.
The theme of the coding was to get used to HTML and to understand how it works, so  did not code screen transitions, but rather faithfully followed the design.
